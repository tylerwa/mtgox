MTGOX History for Excel 
=====

Excel VBA macro that processes and intelligently combines the USD history file and BTC history text files into a single history.

To see how it works download the two history files and workbook below.
* [History (BTC) CSV file](http://tylerwames.com/misc/history_BTC.csv)
* [History (USD) CSV file](http://tylerwames.com/misc/history_BTC.csv)
* [Basick Workbook with macro](http://tylerwames.com/misc/Mtgox.xlsm)

Once downloaded, make sure they are in the same directory and open the workbook.  In column K you will see a button and after you click it the macro will import all the data from the two text files.

To illustrate what you can do with the history in the new format download the following workbook and place it in the same folder as the other files.  When you click the button (column AB) it will import the data as normal but now will show the transaction effects on your balance!
